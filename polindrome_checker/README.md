Palindrome Checker

This Python script checks if a word entered by the user is a palindrome (a word that reads the same forward and backward). It compares the input word with its reverse and prints whether it's a palindrome or not.

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. Enter a word when prompted.
3. The script will check if the word is a palindrome and print the result.
